										<h2 class="major">EE16A</h2>
										<p> I've been a GSI (UC Berkeley's term for Teaching Assistant) for the introductory Electrical Engineering course since fall of 2016, in a variety of positions including teaching discussions, managing the course <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_(Q%26A_platform)">Piazza</a>, and managing our team of readers who grade homework assignments and exams. </p>

										<p>I've written some exam questions in the past, which can be found here. My questions tend to focus on core concepts rather than intensive design or proofs. </p>

									<h2 class="major">EE16A Resources for Students</h2>
									<p> <i> My supplementary notes and links to external resources I think are helpful. </i> </p>

									<p> Need test prep? <a href = "http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/exams/course/ee/16a">HKN</a> and <a href = "http://tbp.berkeley.edu/courses/ee/16A/">TBP</a> both have test banks on their websites. (I have all past exams/solns but am unsure if I can distribute them here, so ask me in person if you would like anything unlisted.) </p>

									<p> I'm currently working on a set of supplementary notes that cover frequently asked questions and common misconceptions I've seen in my discussion sections and on piazza. Circuitikz has a learning curve, so please be patient! And if there is a topic you'd like to see added to my notes, please email me about it.</p>

									<p> The course website has some excellent resources as well, including this <a href = "http://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/icgvkl3p4x5m0/gyor3wfgyon205/if0gvqrkz0ue/edogs2.pdf">circuits reader</a>.</p>

										<h2 class="major">E98</h2>
										<p> As an E98 instructor, I (with two other co-instructors) led a section of 20 freshman engineering students, structured to be a casual lecture setting encouraging question and answers. The course was one of <a href = "http://www.decal.org/3599">UC Berkeley's many decal courses. </a> </p>

										<p>We advised them on many relevant topics including time management, writing resumes, interview attire and behavior, and choosing engineering classes. The course culminated in each student showcasing their oral communication skills by giving a short presentation on a chosen engineering topic (bitcoin, Bart transbay tunnel, DSLR cameras, etc.) </p>

										<h2 class="major">CSM</h2>
										<p> CSM (Computer Science Mentors) is a student-run organization that provides guidance and resources in a smaller classroom environment through group tutoring sessions. There are 4-6 students in each group, and we emphasize a non-judgemental learning environment. I work as a Content Mentor, so in addition to leading a section, I create additional content like worksheets and videos for students to use. View CSM's website <a href = "http://csmberkeley.github.io/#/">here</a>. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Lab Assisting</h2>
										<p> I volunteered as a lab assistant for two semesters after I finished Berkeley's introductory computer science course. This involved assisting in the weekly labs for CS61A, and also helping at course office hours for 1-2 hours per week (more during project weeks). </p>
