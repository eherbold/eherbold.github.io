									<h2 class="major">Encrypted GoogleDocs</h2>

									<p>GoogleDocs is an extremely popular filesharing service among Berkeley students - my friends and I share everything from music, my roommates and I use it to manage chores and purchases, and we even use it to store non-LaTeX files for EE16A. In this project for my Computer Security class, we set out to build our own version of GoogleDocs, but with the added twist of not being able to trust the servers we are hosted on. </p>

									<p> My partner and I spent around a week and a half of intense design and coding for this project, and received nearly a perfect score when our code was run through the barrage of functionality and security tests, only failing to camouflage the recipient of a sharing link. I did not correct for this in my posted code, but explain in the design what we would do to fix this vulnerability. </p>

									<p> Included is a test suite that we wrote. The design, code, and tests are all hosted privately on Github since this was a class project. </p>

									<!-- <p>Cosplay is one of my hobbies, and one summer, a few months before San Diego Comic-Con, I decided to combine my love of sewing and crafting with some circuitry and design a pair of wings that lit up in pre-programmed patterns, controllable by a switch. </p> -->

									<!-- <p>What is China's Great Firewall? In an effort to censor the internet for its citizens, the Chinese goverment created not a true firewall, but an on-path system that is able to view the contents of TCP/IP packets and shut down connections for those who are accessing 'questionable' websites, such as a Google search for Falun Gong. </p>

									<p> Fortunately, it is doable and even easy - with the help of python's scapy - to get around this obstacle, and trick the Great Firewall into letting banned network traffic through. </p>

									<p> Two well-known utilities, ping and traceroute, were reimplemented as helper functions for this project. </p>

									<p> The evasion strategy works as follows: </p> -->
